	<h1>What A Day!</h1>
	<section class="area"> You don’t know how you got here but now you’re really deep inside this cave. Nothing to see here but darkness. Actually, there is a stream of water that might lead you to a bigger body of water if you swim down it, or you can take this minecart you just happened to find with a sign on it saying “I can take you to one out of the many woods in this world.” Want to go to another wood area or swim down the stream of water?</section>
